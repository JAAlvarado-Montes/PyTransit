	abstract = {We present a fast and user friendly exoplanet transit light-curve modelling package PYTRANSIT, implementing optimized versions of the Giménez and Mandel \& Agol transit models. The package offers an object-oriented PYTHON interface to access the two models implemented natively in FORTRAN with OpenMP parallelization. A partial OpenCL version of the quadratic Mandel-Agol model is also included for GPU-accelerated computations. The aim of PYTRANSIT is to facilitate the analysis of photometric time series of exoplanet transits consisting of hundreds of thousands of data points, and of multipassband transit light curves from spectrophotometric observations, as a part of a researcher's programming toolkit for building complex, problem-specific analyses.},

	abstract = {A significant fraction of an exoplanet transit model evaluation time is spent calculating projected distances between the planet and its host star. This is a relatively fast operation for a circular orbit, but slower for an eccentric one. However, because the planet’s position and its time derivatives are constant for any specific point in orbital phase, the projected distance can be calculated rapidly and accurately in the vicinity of the transit by expanding the planet’s x and y positions in the sky plane into a Taylor series at mid-transit. Calculating the projected distance for an elliptical orbit using the four first time derivatives of the position vector (velocity, acceleration, jerk, and snap) is ∼100 times faster than calculating it using the Newton’s method, and also significantly faster than calculating z for a circular orbit because the approach does not use numerically expensive trigonometric functions. The speed gain in the projected distance calculation leads to 2-25 times faster transit model evaluation speed, depending on the transit model complexity and orbital eccentricity. Calculation of the four position derivatives using numerical differentiation takes ∼1 μs with a modern laptop and needs to be done only once for a given orbit, and the maximum error the approximation introduces to a transit light curve is below 1 ppm for the major part of the physically plausible orbital parameter space.},

	abstract = {I present RoadRunner, a fast exoplanet transit model that can use any radially symmetric function to model stellar limb darkening (LD) while still being faster to evaluate than the analytical transit model for quadratic LD by Mandel \& Agol. CPU and GPU implementations of the model are available in the pytransit transit modelling package, and come with platform-independent parallelization, supersampling, and support for modelling complex heterogeneous time series. The code is written in numba-accelerated python (and the GPU model in opencl) without c or fortran dependencies, which allows for the LD model to be given as any python-callable function. Finally, as an example of the flexibility of the approach, the latest version of pytransit comes with a numerical limb darkening model that uses LDTk-generated limb darkening profiles directly without approximating them by analytical models.},
